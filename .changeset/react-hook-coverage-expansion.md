Expand React-first integration coverage with new first-class hooks:

- `useCodexDynamicTools` (plus dynamic tool payload/call derivation helpers)
- `useCodexRuntimeBridge`
- `useCodexAccountAuth`
- `useCodexThreads`

Also extend `useCodexConversationController` to bundle dynamic tool handling and update React integration/docs to reflect the hook-first canonical path.
