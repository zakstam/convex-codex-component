Add a package-owned Tauri host adapter export at `@zakstam/codex-local-component/host/tauri`.

This adds typed bridge client wrappers, helper-command parsing/dispatch metadata, and generation utilities for Rust bridge/permission artifacts so consumers no longer need app-local bridge-contract generators.
