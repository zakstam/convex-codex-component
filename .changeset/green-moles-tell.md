Fix package setup documentation drift and add a shared example apps runbook.

- Add `docs/EXAMPLE_APPS_RUNBOOK.md` as a canonical setup/check command reference.
- Harden docs single-path checks so runbook references must stay valid in package docs and onboarding prompt text.
- Add repo-owned `skills/package-setup` guidance for fail-closed package setup workflows.
