Tighten canonical integration onboarding with fail-fast diagnostics and stronger drift checks.

- Add `doctor:integration` to detect doc and canonical-contract drift with actionable failure output.
- Add `check:canonical-symbols` to block legacy external-id aliases in package docs.
- Update canonical docs/runbook/examples to route users to one integration source of truth.
