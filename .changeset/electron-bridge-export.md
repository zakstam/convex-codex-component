Add `host/bridge` and `host/electron` exports for Electron integration. The `host/bridge` export provides framework-agnostic bridge types and utilities extracted from the Tauri-specific module. The `host/electron` export provides `createElectronBridgeClient` for Electron IPC-based bridge communication.
