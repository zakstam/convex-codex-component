# Tauri Example (Desktop + Convex Persistence)

This app is the blessed reference integration for production-grade React + Convex host wiring.
React hooks are the official recommendation for consumer integrations.

LLM onboarding entrypoint: `packages/codex-local-component/LLMS.md`.

Canonical wiring in this app centers on:
- `CodexProvider` + `useCodex`
- `useCodexRuntimeBridge`
- `useCodexThreadState`
- `useCodexTauriEvents` (single owner for Tauri runtime event subscriptions)
- generated host shim endpoints in `convex/chat.ts`

Canonical consumer implementation path:

- `packages/codex-local-component/LLMS.md`
- `packages/codex-local-component/docs/CANONICAL_INTEGRATION.md`

This README is app-specific operational guidance only; package docs are the integration source of truth.

## State Authority

- Runtime start/stop UI signals must be sourced from `codex:bridge_state`.
- `useCodexTauriEvents` is the only place that subscribes to Tauri bridge events.
- The hook is StrictMode-safe and deduplicates transition toasts to one toast per real running-state edge.

## Tool Policy Panel

- Use the **Tool Policy** panel in the sidebar to block known dynamic tools for the current session.
- Toggle checks are mapped into a policy list and sent through `set_disabled_tools`.
- The runtime enforces the policy inside the bridge helper:
  - blocked tools are denied before any execution,
  - unknown tool names are rejected by the helper command handler.
- In this example, the known dynamic tool is `tauri_get_runtime_snapshot`.

## Runbook and Setup

- Shared run/check commands and required variables live in [packages/codex-local-component/docs/EXAMPLE_APPS_RUNBOOK.md](../../packages/codex-local-component/docs/EXAMPLE_APPS_RUNBOOK.md).
- Relevant section: `Tauri Example`.
- Create `apps/examples/tauri-app/.env.local` with `VITE_CONVEX_URL=...` and app-specific optional overrides as documented there.
- CI runs `pnpm --filter codex-local-tauri-example run typecheck` whenever host/type boundary paths change to protect generated `api.chat.*` contracts.

## Actor Security

- On first launch, the app prompts for a username and persists it in local storage.
- By default, actor lock is disabled and any username can be used.
- Set `TAURI_ACTOR_LOCK=1` in Convex server env to enable host binding and reject mismatched actor identities.
- On startup, the app reconciles to existing server-side lock/pin state (`chat.getActorBindingForBootstrap`) before loading thread data.
- Optional hard pin: set `ACTOR_USER_ID` in Convex server env to pin the accepted actor from startup.

## Raw Protocol Verification

To verify exactly what Codex emits before host parsing, run the Tauri helper with:

```bash
CODEX_BRIDGE_RAW_LOG=turns pnpm run dev
```

The helper prints raw stdin lines from `codex app-server` to stderr with prefix:

`[codex-bridge:raw-in] ...`

## Start Command Tracing

`start_bridge` emits structured diagnostics into `codex:global_message` so duplicate starts can be identified from one click:

- `kind: "bridge/start_trace"`
- `phase: "received"` and `phase: "result"`
- `traceId`, `tsMs`, `source` (for example `manual_start_button`, `composer_retry`)
- `runningBefore` and selected thread arguments

## Bridge Command Contract

- Bridge command wiring is package-owned from `@zakstam/codex-local-component/host/tauri`.
- The app consumes `createTauriBridgeClient(...)`, helper command parsing, and helper ack policy from package exports.
- `pnpm run prepare:tauri-assets` regenerates Rust command/dispatch/invoke-handler files and permission TOML files from package-owned metadata.
- Generated Rust artifacts:
  - `src-tauri/src/bridge_contract_generated.rs`
  - `src-tauri/src/bridge_dispatch_generated.rs`
  - `src-tauri/src/bridge_invoke_handlers_generated.rs`
  - `src-tauri/permissions/autogenerated/*.toml`
- Rust command registration uses generated invoke handlers (`bridge_generate_handler!`) instead of a manually maintained command list in `src-tauri/src/main.rs`.
- Do not manually edit generated Rust bridge artifacts or permission files.

## ChatGPT Token Contract

When using ChatGPT auth token login/refresh flows, the payload now follows the latest app-server schema:

- `accessToken` (required)
- `chatgptAccountId` (required)
- `chatgptPlanType` (optional, nullable)

## Host Surface Ownership

- `convex/chat.ts`: generated app-owned public surface (`api.chat.*`) using `defineCodexHostDefinitions(...)` + explicit Convex `mutation/query` exports
- `convex/chat.extensions.ts`: app-owned endpoints (`listThreadsForPicker`, `getActorBindingForBootstrap`, `resolveThreadHandleForStart`)
- Host shim drift is enforced with `pnpm run sync:host-shim` and `pnpm run check:host-shim`.

## Thread API

- Thread picker flow: `chat.listThreadsForPicker`.
- Picker payloads expose only persisted `threadId` values; runtime thread-id mapping is helper-internal.
- Runtime-owned `ensureThread` is single-path and requires `threadId`.

Additional cleanup endpoints:

- `chat.deleteThread`
- `chat.scheduleDeleteThread`
- `chat.deleteTurn`
- `chat.scheduleDeleteTurn`
- `chat.purgeActorData`
- `chat.schedulePurgeActorData`
- `chat.cancelDeletion`
- `chat.forceRunDeletion`
- `chat.getDeletionStatus`

The Data cleanup panel schedules deletions with a grace window (10 minutes by default), allows undo/cancel before execution, and includes a force-run action to execute immediately.
